👋 Hi, I'm Nicholas Robin Omondi Fwaya. Yeah, I get it, that's why I prefer Nick Fwaya!

🚀 I'm a passionate computer science graduate who's well-versed in modern full stack web development using TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Node.js. With experience in building dynamic, performant, and user-friendly web applications, I'm excited to bring my skills to your team and tackle new challenges.

🌱 I’m currently learning trpc, zod, prisma, sveltekit, react native, dart and flutter. I know, all about the grind.

👨‍💻 I love to write clean, well-documented, and maintainable code. My skills range from creating responsive and accessible user interfaces to designing and building scalable backend systems.

👨‍🎓 During my time at Kisii University, I gained extensive experience in software engineering, data structures, algorithms, and databases. I'm always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in technology.

🔎 I'm currently seeking new opportunities to grow and contribute to a dynamic team that values innovation, collaboration, and diversity.
